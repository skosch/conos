README file for kpk2cmd

Pk2cmd started as a Windows (TM) only program by Microchip (TM). Fortunately, 
they released the source allowing Jeff Post, to port it to linux. The upside to
all of this is that it worked quite well.

The downside is that there was no graphical interface - until now.

Kpk2cmd is a program that uses QT and KDE to provide a graphical user interface
to pk2cmd. Kpk2cmd is an original work by Canna Software with a small portion
that originated with Jeff Post (from his PK2 project).
