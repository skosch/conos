Installation instructions
-------------------------

You'll need at least gpsim-0.21.11 for this to work.

un tar the graphic_lcd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz tarball and then:

$ cd graphic_lcd-X.Y.Z
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit

At this point, the Graphic LCD module has been compiled and installed
as a shared library that can be loaded by gpsim. If you want to
see if it works, then run the example:

$ cd graphic_lcd-X.Y.Z/examples
$ make
$ gpsim -s glcd_test.cod

This will assemble the PIC code that tests the LCD module.This code is
fairly complete and can be used as an LCD driver for a real PIC/LCD board.

When gpsim comes up, you should see the Graphic LCD display. A random
number of pixels will be on. As you single step through the code, you
can see some of the test patterns written to the display.


Subversion
----------

If you're getting the code from Subversion, you'll need to generate files
that are unique to your system. This is done with the script:

$ libtoolize
$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake --add-missing
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
